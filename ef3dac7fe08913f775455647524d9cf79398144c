      "message": "This won\u0027t fly. There\u0027s no way of distinguishing between cases where the `FFA_SUCCESS` has arguments but they happen to be zero and cases where the it doesn\u0027t have arguments.\nFor example if an application does a `FFA_FEATURES/Notification pending interrupt` query, it would get a `None32` if the interrupt ID is actually zero, while it should always get `Result32` regardless of the interrupt ID.\nI agree that the success argument handling needs some overhaul, but not this way. Please stand by for some design plans.",

This way, the user should only use `Empty` when the actual SuccessArgs should not be interpreted in any way.\n\nI\u0027ve done the change, please let me know if this makes sense or I should drop this patch.\n\nWe could make any further changes in a following patch if this needs more precision.",
