      "message": "This won\u0027t fly. There\u0027s no way of distinguishing between cases where the `FFA_SUCCESS` has arguments but they happen to be zero and cases where the it doesn\u0027t have arguments.\nFor example if an application does a `FFA_FEATURES/Notification pending interrupt` query, it would get a `None32` if the interrupt ID is actually zero, while it should always get `Result32` regardless of the interrupt ID.\nI agree that the success argument handling needs some overhaul, but not this way. Please stand by for some design plans.",
