      "message": "Sorry I don\u0027t agree with this change. In my understanding the `INVALID_PARAMETERS` error code means that the function ID was recognised, but some arguments of the call are invalid. It has a specific meaning for the interfaces where it\u0027s valid to return this error, as described in the spec (e.g. for `FFA_RXTX_UNMAP`: There is no buffer pair registered on behalf of the caller, for `FFA_PARTITION_INFO_GET`: Unrecognized UUID, etc).\n\nThe FF-A spec doesn\u0027t clearly state this, but in general it uses the `NOT_SUPPORTED` error code every time when a function ID is not recognised. This is usually because it\u0027s an optional function or it\u0027s from a newer version of the spec. Assuming that the caller of this library did at least a sanity check to see if the function ID is valid and in FF-A\u0027s SMCCC range, I think returning `NOT_SUPPORTED` will be the correct action for anything that we can\u0027t recognise.",
